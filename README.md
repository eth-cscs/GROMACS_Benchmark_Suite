# GROMACS_Benchmark_Suite
Input files for GROMACS testing and benchmarking

GROMACS .tpr input files are stored in binary format and are sometimes over >100MB in size. Thus github is perhaps not an ideal place
to host these files. However, we want to share the collection with other centers and accept contribution from others.
This repo can be removed once a better place to host these files has been found.

This repo should collect different benchmark suites for the GROMACS software. 

The different benchmark suites should have a dedicated folder

* HECBioSim is for the [HECBioSim](https://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/access-hpc/benchmarks)


* Nvidia's [MPS-Benchmarking Suite](https://zenodo.org/record/3893789/files/GROMACS_heterogeneous_parallelization_benchmark_info_and_systems_JCP.tar.gz) for benchmarks on heterogeneous systems

More input files will be added, also for testing with PLUMED.
